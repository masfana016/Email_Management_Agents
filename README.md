# EmailBot - AI-Powered Email Assistant

EmailBot is an AI-powered email assistant designed to help users manage their email-related tasks efficiently. It integrates with Gmail to read, compose, and send emails, as well as handle attachments. The backend is built using Python (FastAPI, LangGraph, and PostgreSQL), and the frontend is a React-based web application. One of the standout features of EmailBot is its **voice input capability**, which allows users to interact with the assistant using speech-to-text technology.
